# CodeAlpha – Basic Network Sniffer

## Task Overview - 1
This project is part of the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship.
The goal of this task is to understand how network data travels by capturing
and analyzing network packets.

## Objective
- Capture live network packets
- Analyze packet information such as source IP, destination IP, protocol, and payload
- Learn basic network communication concepts

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scapy library

## Features
- Captures network traffic packets
- Displays source and destination IP addresses
- Identifies protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP
- Helps understand how data flows in a network

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding packet structure
- Basic knowledge of network protocols
- Hands-on experience with packet sniffing

## Security Note
This project is created for educational purposes only.
Packet sniffing should only be performed on authorized networks.

## Conclusion
This task provided practical exposure to network monitoring
and helped build a foundation in network security concepts.
